    <h1>Baker's Dozen</h1>
    <h2>By Michelle Barresi</h2>
    <p> No one knows the actual origin of Brioche, but they do know that it is a delicious light and fluffy bread. It is also used in a variety of dishes from hamburgers to french toast. I chose to use Brioche as my final project because recently I decided to dabble in  baking. Although the process can be stressful, it is always the end result that is the most rewarding. Although this is slightly tacky, the message I am trying to convey is similar to life itself. The process of life is very messy and most of the time very frustrating. Fighting past all the stress and obstacles life throws at us, we can be satisfied with the end result, like the end of the semester or some really good bread. </p>
